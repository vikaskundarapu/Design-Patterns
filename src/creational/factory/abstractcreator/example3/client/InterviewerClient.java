/**
 * Consider the case of a hiring manager. It is impossible for one person to
 * interview for each of the positions. Based on the job opening, she has to
 * decide and delegate the interview steps to different people.
 * 
 * It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.
 * 
 * In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational
 * pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating
 * objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be
 * created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either
 * specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in
 * a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by
 * calling a constructor.
 * 
 * Useful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required
 * sub-class is dynamically decided at runtime. Or putting it in other words,
 * when the client doesn't know what exact sub-class it might need.
