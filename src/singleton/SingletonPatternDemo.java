 * This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this
 * pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. This
 * pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an
 * object while making sure that only single object gets created. 
 * This class provides a way to access its only object which can be 
 * accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.*/
